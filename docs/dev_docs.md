This section provides an overview of the project's architecture and related resources.

## Architecture Diagram

To better understand the system's architecture, you can view the detailed diagram below:  

[here](../docs/public/R_type_architecture.pdf)  

The diagram outlines the key components and interactions within the project, showing how different modules and services communicate with each other.

## Binary Protocol

Regarding communication between client and server, we use a binary protocol.
To achieve this, we defined a few basic commands so both client and server can communicate.
You can find all of them here:
